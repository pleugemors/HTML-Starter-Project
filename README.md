# HTML-Starter-Project

This is just a starter project to show that we can make a web page.
I made a quick character page initialization page that had a few form inputs.
After filling out the information, it is passed on to the next page which just displays the incomming 
information.  I could not get the radio button to pass the appropriate value yet and will be agenda to finish.
The way I did this was not in any way real safe due to the fact that I parsed the url script to get the information.
I know I need to work on that next.
